SETTING UP

1) the mysql should be on port number 8889, if your mysql is not installed on port 8889 then you will have two options
    :-> you may change your mysql portnumber to 8889(recommended).
    
    (or)
    
    :-> go to https://github.com/ShekharReddy4/quiznew/blob/master/META-INF/context.xml#L7  and change 8889 to (your mysql port number).
    :-> you need to compile all the classes through command line using the command ___________

the above setup is recommended only if your mysql isn't installed in portnumber 8889 otherwise a simple clone of the repository and
running catalina works fine
